This address can be shared publicly with others, and is completely safe to do so. You can send and receive funds from and to your wallet address. Basically, the address is your unique identifier on the blockchain and represents your 'account.' \r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <div className='w-full bg-white text-black '>\r\n              <p className='text-gray-500 mr-2'>\r\n                An example of an Ethereum address is :\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p className='text-gray-500 mr-2'>\r\n                 0x01573Df433484fCBe6325a0c6E051Dc62Ab107D1\r\n              </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            <br />\r\n            <hr className='h-0.5 w-full bg-slate-600 dark:bg-gray-800 my-4' />\r\n            <h2 id='frontend technologies' className='text-2xl font-semibold'>\r\n               What are private keys? 🔐\r\n            </h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n              A private key is the counterpart to an address. Each address has an associated private key. As the name suggests though, this is meant to be kept private and not shared with anyone.\r\n            </p><p>\r\n                <br/>\r\n               You can think of it like a password, a really strong one, that contains a bunch of letters and numbers that allow you to prove ownership over your address. Anyone who has the private key has access to make transactions from your address i.e. send money from your address to theirs.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <div className='w-full bg-white text-black '>\r\n              <p className='text-gray-500 mr-2'>\r\n                  A private key looks something like this: \r\n              </p>\r\n              <p className='text-gray-500 mr-2'>\r\nE9873D79C6D87DC0FB6A5778633389F4453213303DA61F20BD67FC233AA33262\r\n\r\n\r\n              </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <p>\r\n                <br/>\r\n               If you think of your address as a username for your account, the private key is its password. Therefore sharing your address is okay, but never ever share your private key or someone might steal your funds - and then nothing can be done about it.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <div className='w-full bg-white rounded-md text-black '>\r\n              <p className='text-gray-500 mr-2'>\r\n                 <strong>Caution</strong>: Since blockchains are decentralized, there is no 'forgot password' option. If you lose your private key, you lose access to your account. Similarly, if someone steals your private key and steals your funds, you cannot do anything about it. It is VERY important to keep this private key safe.\r\n              </p>\r\n            \r\n            </div>\r\n            <p>\r\n                <br/>\r\n               For developers, we often use the private key as part of our codebase to perform certain transactions, such as deploying our own smart contracts to the Ethereum network. While you are still learning, we highly suggest you use a separate account entirely for development than you use for storing any sort of funds. Unfortunately, beginner developers often use the same account they have funds on, and accidentally share their codebase publicly - and hackers can see your private key in the codebase and end up stealing funds. Please take that as a tale of caution.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <hr className='h-0.5 w-full bg-slate-600 dark:bg-gray-800 my-4' />\r\n            <h2 id='frontend technologies' className='text-2xl font-semibold'>\r\n               What are private keys? 🔐\r\n            </h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n                <br/>\r\n                Particularly, these standards are set around the three key things every web developer needs to have some familiarity with - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                <br/>\r\n               HTML is the language used to visually place elements on your screen. Things like this paragraph you're reading right now, things like buttons, things like a dropdown menu. You visually place elements across the screen using HTML.\r\n\r\n\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                <br/>\r\n               CSS is a styling language used to add styles and your own custom flair to these elements. By default, HTML elements look boring and plain. Remember those old 90s websites? Yeah, that was plain HTML. CSS allows you to customize things about HTML elements. Such as making a button round instead of a rectangle, changing the font of a paragraph, having some bold text or underlined text, and so on.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                <br/>\r\n                And finally, to tie it all together comes JavaScript. JavaScript is arguably the most important aspect of building on web technologies. It is a fully functional programming language that is used to add real functionality to your website. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                <br/>\r\n               With HTML and CSS, you can place elements on a screen and make them look nice - but they won't actually do anything. Your button wouldn't actually do anything if you click it, more posts on Instagram will not load as you kept scrolling down, and so on.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                <br/>\r\n               JavaScript allows you to add real interactivity and functionality to your websites. It is, without a doubt, the language of the web - and you will find that most of the lessons here on LearnWeb3 will use JavaScript in one way or the other. A website without JavaScript has no functionality other than letting you look at things a certain way. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                <br/>\r\n                Anyway, going back to the W3C - the W3C sets standards around how a web browser like Chrome must understand, run, and display the code being written by a web developer using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Because of those standards, all browsers across all devices and all operating systems work similarly and you do not have to worry about it. That's the power of building on web technologies. Unlike building mobile apps, where iOS and Android differ a lot from each other, or how building for Windows is very different from building for macOS or building for Linux - the web allows you to write your code once, and have it work everywhere - and we are going to leverage that.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n            <hr className='h-0.5 w-full bg-slate-600 dark:bg-gray-800 my-4' />\r\n            <h2 id='frontend technologies' className='text-2xl font-semibold'>\r\n                Backend Technologies\r\n            </h2>\r\n            <p>\r\n              The backend refers to that part of a software that allows it to operate and cannot be directly accessed by the user. Most private data, business logic, data processing, etc. happens on the backend, and the frontend is to provide a visual representation of that data.\r\n            </p><p>\r\n                <br/>\r\n                For example, consider Instagram - Instagram has billions and billions of photos and videos on their platform. Some of those photos are posted by private accounts, photos that only people who follow that private account can see and anyone else cannot. The filtering of photos required for Instagram to show you your feed on the timeline vs. what they actually have available to them happens on their backend. It is important the backend is not directly accessible by users because otherwise private data can be leaked.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                <br/>\r\n               If you've ever read news about some website getting hacked and user's private information - their address, names, credit cards, etc. - being leaked, that is because there was some bug in their backend that allowed a malicious actor to directly gain access to it. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                <br/>\r\n               It is our goal as software developers to build secure backends for our services and only allow the user access to information and data they should have access to. \r\n            </p>\r\n           <p>\r\n                <br/>\r\n                Backend services can be written in a variety of programming languages - JavaScript, Rust, Go, Python, C#, and many more. As you're starting your journey however, since you're going to be learning JavaScript anyway for the frontend, you might as well use JavaScript for the backend as well. While each programming language has it's own pros and cons, they are not enough for a beginner to try to master multiple different languages and paradigms at once. I highly recommend that if you want to build on web technologies, you choose JavaScript because it works on both ends of the tech stack.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <br />\r\n           <div className='flex justify-between items-center'>\r\n             <div className=''>\r\n             <button  onClick={backclickHandler}\r\n        class=\"  transition-all focus-outline-none   flex items-center justify-center  border border-transparent text-base font-medium rounded-sm text-white bg-red-600 hover:bg-red-700 md:py-4 md:text-lg md:px-10 h-10 cursor-pointer\"\r\n        type=\"button\">\r\n        Back\r\n      </button>\r\n        </div>\r\n         <div className=''>\r\n             <button  onClick={quizclickHandler}\r\n        class=\"  transition-all focus-outline-none   flex items-center justify-center  border border-transparent text-base font-medium rounded-sm text-white bg-red-600 hover:bg-red-700 md:py-4 md:text-lg md:px-10 h-10 cursor-pointer\"\r\n        type=\"button\">\r\n        Start Quiz\r\n      </button>\r\n        </div>\r\n           </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n       \r\n\r\n        <hr className='h-0.5 w-full bg-slate-600 dark:bg-gray-800 my-4' />\r\n        <br />\r\n      <div>\r\n        <h3 className=' font-semibold text-2xl text-white px-28 '>\r\n            want to ask anything ?\r\n        </h3>\r\n        <br></br>\r\n        <div className='  px-8 flex justify-around items-center '>\r\n          <input type='email' placeholder='enter your email' required className='rounded-sm h-10 w-1/3' >\r\n          </input>\r\n          \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        <button \r\n        class=\"  transition-all focus-outline-none cursor-pointer  flex items-center justify-center  border border-transparent text-base font-medium rounded-sm text-white bg-red-600 hover:bg-red-700 md:py-4 md:text-lg md:px-10 h-10 cursor-pointer\"\r\n        type=\"button\">\r\n        send\r\n      </button>\r\n      \r\n    \r\n     <div></div>\r\n     <div></div>\r\n     <var><div>\r\n    </div></var>\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <hr className='h-0.5 w-full bg-slate-600 dark:bg-gray-800 my-4' />\r\n        <br />\r\n        <div className='flex justify-between px-8 '>\r\n            <div className=''>\r\n               <a href=\"#\" className=\"text-3xl font-extrabold text-white\">\r\n              StudyNotion\r\n            </a>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className='text-white'>\r\n           © 2023 StudyNotion, Inc.
